  heading: Why Northwales.coffee?
  text: >-
    We moved to North Wales (Rhewl to be precise) from London (via a stint in
    Chester) during the Pandemic in 2021 and being coffee lovers at heart we
    craved some good Coffee.


    We're fans of local independent businesses, and at first we struggled to find good Coffee that was roasted in the local area, but after a bit of searching, we found an amazing little coffee scene and this blog is all about showing off the amazing people here.
intro:
  heading: What we will do
  text: >-
    We're still working out what we will do exactly, but right now we want to
    showcase local roasters and their businesses. Local independent coffee shops
    that use the local coffees. And review coffee that has been roasted locally.


    In the unlikely event that someone grows coffee beans in North Wales, we will showcase that too.
products:

    will pay our own way for everything that we review.
