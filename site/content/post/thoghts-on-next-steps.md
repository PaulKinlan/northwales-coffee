description: Some thoughts on how to use this blog.
---
I've been loving the coffee that we've been having from places around the area, but I've also realised that I am not very good at tasting all the notes in the coffee so "reviewing" will not create a lot of content :D

I maintain my site "[Modern Web Development](https://paul.kinlan.me/)" and it's my professional presence and over a coffee I often think about things that I would like to do that are not work related, so I'm turning this little home here in to a little space to muse on things that are not technology related, but have been inspired by coffee.

I still intend to write about the Coffee we drink, but a bit more on the side too.
