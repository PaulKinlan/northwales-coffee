description: A list of all the roasters that I know of in North Wales.

This page is a list of all the roasteries that I've discovered in North Wales. I will keep updating this list with more thoughts and information that I can find out.

## Owen and Edwards

We live just outside Ruthin and I've seen a number of local shops selling their Coffee. They have plenty of different blends and packaging is available in both Welsh and English. The bags come either Ground or Wholebean.

They're [local with a place](http://owenandedwards.com/) on the Lon Parcway estate but I don't think you can walk up to the roaster and buy coffee, it looks to be a wholesale operation.

Places that we've have seen this coffee:

* [Welsh food](https://www.welshfood.co.uk/owen-and-edwards-ground-coffee---castell-mediumdark-roast-1-123-p.asp) - Pentre near Denbigh
* More to come

## Mug Run

We met the owner of [Mug Run](https://www.mug-run.com/) at the Denbigh Plum Festival a little earlier this year. We've tried a good couple of blends and they've been great (Serene's favourite so far).

The coffee comes as Whole Beans (we didn't see pre-ground) and is also available on their website.

Places that we've have seen this coffee:

* [Sugarplum tea room](https://www.sugarplumtearoom.co.uk/) - Rhewl - this is a very nice tea room, with lots of nice meals and cakes (and coffee)
* [Y TÅ· Gwyrdd](https://www.ytygwyrdd.cymru/shop-all?Collection=Coffee) - Denbigh (Zero Waste community hub)

## Heartland

Based up in LLandudno is [Heartland](https://heartland.coffee/), I popped in one day when I was getting fish from Mermaids fishmongers. The place looked great, it was split in two: the area where they bake the coffee and on the left is a place where you can go in and pick up a bag or two - it looked like you might be able to walk up to the bar, but given Covid times I only waited by the door.

Places that we've have seen this coffee:

* [Providero](https://www.facebook.com/providero) - Llandudno & Llandudno Junction.
