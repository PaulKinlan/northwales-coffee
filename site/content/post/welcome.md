Welcome! We are [Paul](https://twitter.com/Paul_Kinlan) and Serene.

We are building this site because we love Coffee and we love North Wales. This site is our little project to help raise the visibility of the great coffee that is made right here in North Wales.

Our hope is that we can shine a little light on the independent and local roasters, their coffee and coffee shops  that are sprinkled across the region.

We drink a lot of coffee, but slowly. So we expect that this blog will be a slow boil.

Given we only just moved to the region, our Welsh language skills are non-existent, but we are learning and one day we hope we can also provide more Welsh Language content here too.

Cheers!
